Refureku is a powerful C++17 RTTI free runtime reflection library based on [Kodgen](https://github.com/jsoysouvanh/Kodgen).
It allows to retrieve information on namespaces, structs/classes, fields, methods, non-member variables, non-member functions, enums and enum values at runtime.

## Features
- Easy to integrate in a software like a game engine
- Reflect namespaces, structs, classes, methods, fields, variables, functions, enums and enum values
- Support structs/classes with or without inheritance (multiple inheritance supported)
- Can get an entity by name, with additional filtering parameters
- Function/Method call with any arguments and any return type (public, protected, private, virtual, override)
- Variable/Field get/set any data of any type (public, protected, private)
- Know at runtime if an instance of a reflected struct/class is the base or a subclass of another reflected struct/class
- Powerful property system allowing to attach metadata on any entity and generate custom code
- Reflection metadata is regenerated only when a file has changed
- Can instantiate any objects just from an archetype (which is obtainable by name or id), with arbitrary parameters
- Know at compile-time if a struct/class is reflected or not (can be combined with if constexpr expression)

## Getting started
**Pre-built binaries for Windows x64 are available [here](https://github.com/jsoysouvanh/Refureku/releases). If you want to use those, you can skip to step 3 (this is true for the [Library Integration part](#library-integration) as well as the [Parser/Generator Integration part](#parsergenerator-integration).**

**Refureku integration examples are available [here](https://github.com/jsoysouvanh/Refureku/tree/master/Refureku/Examples).**

### Requirements:
- CMake 3.15.0+ (if you build the library from source).
- A compatible compiler: MSVC Platform Toolset v141+ / GCC8.0.0+ / Clang 7.0.0+.

### Library integration
1. Pull the repository
2. Compile the library and the generator following these steps:
	- At the root of the Refureku folder, open a terminal
		- cmake -B Build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "\<Generator\>"
			> Most common generators include:
			> - Visual Studio 15 2017 -> cmake -B Build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64
			>**Note:** If you use Visual Studio generator, you must explicitely specify the target architecture using -A x64
			> - Unix Makefiles
			> - Ninja -> cmake -B Build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Ninja"
			> - Type cmake -G for more information
		- cmake --build Build/Release --config Release --target **RefurekuGenerator Refureku**
	- If you're compiling your project in debug mode, you will also probably need the debug version too:
		- cmake -B Build/Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "\<Generator\>"
		- cmake --build Build/Debug --config Debug --target **Refureku**
	- You will find the generator binaries in Build/Release/Bin/ and the library in Build/[Debug|Release]/Lib/
		> **Note:** On multiple configuration generators such as Visual Studio or XCode, an additional Debug/Release folder is generated.

3.  Add necessary header directories to your project settings:
    - From binaries: /Include/
    - From source: /Refureku/Library/Include/

4.  Add library directories to your projet settings:
    - From binaries: /Lib/
    - From source: /Build/[Debug|Release]/Lib/
    > Make sure /Build/Debug/Lib/ is only set in debug mode, and /Build/Release/Lib/ only in release mode

5.  Link against:
    - From binaries: RefurekuDebug.lib in debug mode, RefurekuRelease.lib in release mode
    - From source: Refureku.lib

7. Update RefurekuSettings.toml located in /Build/Release/Bin/, or /Bin/ if you downloaded the binaries. You must at least specify:
	- [FileGenerationSettings] outputDirectory = '''Path/To/Output/Directory'''
		> The output directory is the directory where metadata files will be generated. If the directory doesn't exist, the generator will try to create it. 
	- [FileGenerationSettings] toParseDirectories = [ '''Path/To/Dir/To/Parse1''', ... ]
		> List of the directories containing header files to parse. These directories are recursively inspected.
	- [FileParsingSettings] projectIncludeDirectories = [ '''Path/To/Refureku/Library/Include''', '''Path/To/Your/Project/Include/Dir1''', ... ]
		> Paths to your project's additional include directories. They are **absolutely necessary** to make sure the parser can find all included files. As you added Refureku include directory at step 3, you must add it to the list.
	- [FileParsingSettings] compilerExeName = "clang++"
		> Fill this with the compiler you are using to compile your application. "msvc", "clang++" and "g++" are the only supported compilers. For clang++ and g++, you can specify a version (as long as the command is properly running in a terminal).
	- **If the specified outputDirectory is in a parsed directory**, you should ignore it (you don't want to waste time parsing generated metadata do you?)
	[FileGenerationSettings] ignoredDirectories = [ '''Path/To/Output/Directory''' ]
	> **Note:** All paths must be written between ''' ''', and be either absolute or relative to your workspace directory.
	
8. Make the RefurekuGenerator run just before your project's compilation:
	- With CMake:
	```cmake
	# Run generator before compiling our own program
	add_custom_target(RunGenerator
				WORKING_DIRECTORY Your/Working/Directory
				COMMAND Path/To/The/RefurekuGenerator)
	add_dependencies(YourExecutable RunGenerator)
	```
	- With Visual Studio:
		> In Project properties > Build Events > Pre-Build Event, add the command Path\To\Executable\RefurekuGenerator.exe

9. Make sure you compile your project in C++17 or later.
10. Compile your project: you should see build logs from the RefurekuGenerator with a list of parsed files, or error logs if something went wrong. If you encounter errors, see the [Possible issues section](#possible-issues). If it doesn't help, don't hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/jsoysouvanh/Refureku/issues).

### Parser/Generator integration
1. Pull the repository
2. Compile the generator library following these steps:
	- At the root of the Refureku folder, open a terminal
		- cmake -B Build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "\<Generator\>"
			> Most common generators include:
			> - Visual Studio 15 2017 -> cmake -B Build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64
				>**Note:** If you use Visual Studio generator, you must explicitely specify the target architecture using -A x64
			> - Unix Makefiles
			> - Ninja -> cmake -B Build/Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Ninja"
			> - Type cmake -G for more information
		- cmake --build Build/Release --config Release --target **RefurekuGeneratorLib**
	- If you're compiling your project in debug mode, you will also probably need the debug version too:
		- cmake -B Build/Debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "\<Generator\>"
		- cmake --build Build/Debug --config Debug --target **RefurekuGeneratorLib**
	- You will find the built libraries in Build/[Debug|Release]/Lib/
		> **Note:** On multiple configuration generators such as Visual Studio or XCode, an additional Debug/Release folder is generated.

3.  Add necessary header directories to your project settings:
    - From binaries: /Include/
    - From source:
	    - /Refureku/Generator/Submodules/Kodgen/Include/
	    - /Refureku/Generator/Submodules/Kodgen/ThirdParty/Include/
	    - /Refureku/Generator/Include/

4.  Add library directories to your projet settings:
    - From binaries:
	    - /Lib/
    - From source:
	    - /Refureku/Generator/Submodules/Kodgen/ThirdParty/x64/Static/
	    - /Build/[Debug|Release]/Lib/
    > Make sure /Build/Debug/Lib/ is only set in debug mode, and /Build/Release/Lib/ only in release mode

5.  Link against:
    - From binaries:
	    - clang.lib
	    - KodgenDebug.lib in debug only, KodgenRelease.lib in release only
	    - RefurekuGeneratorLibDebug.lib in debug only, RefurekuGeneratorLibRelease.lib in release only
    - From source:
	    - clang.lib
	    - Kodgen.lib
	    - RefurekuGeneratorLib.lib

6.  Setup your project C++ compilation version to C++17 or later.
7.  Compile!
8.  Before running your program, make sure that the libclang dynamic library is located next to your executable. You should find it at /Refureku/Generator/Submodules/Kodgen/ThirdParty/x64/Shared/, or /Bin/ from the binaries.

You should be able to run the following snippet:

```cpp
#include <Kodgen/Misc/DefaultLogger.h>
#include <RefurekuGenerator/Parsing/FileParser.h>
#include <RefurekuGenerator/Parsing/FileParserFactory.h>
#include <RefurekuGenerator/CodeGen/FileGenerator.h>
#include <RefurekuGenerator/CodeGen/FileGenerationUnit.h>

int main()
{
    rfk::FileParserFactory<rfk::FileParser> fileParserFactory;
    rfk::FileGenerator                      fileGenerator;
    rfk::FileGenerationUnit                 fileGenerationUnit;

    //Set logger
    kodgen::DefaultLogger logger;

    fileParserFactory.logger	= &logger;
    fileGenerator.logger	= &logger;

    //You will need to setup parsing settings and generation settings here.
    //Either load settings from a settings file, or set them by calling the appropriate methods.
    fileGenerator.generateFiles(fileParserFactory, fileGenerationUnit);

    return 0;
}
```

### Possible issues
#### Issue 1
If you compile your program in debug mode, your compiler might complain about library / debug level mismatchs. In that case, make sure to compile the Refureku library both in Debug and Release, and link against the debug version of the library when compiling your program in debug mode.
